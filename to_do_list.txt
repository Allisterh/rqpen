1. Scale X variables before using penalized methods. Then scale coefficients back to original scale. This is because penalized methods are 
   not invariant to scale so best if all penalized variables are on the same scale. 
2. Smarter way to choose lambdas for cv.rq.pen
3. Allow users to specify a vector of lambdas for cv.rq.pen function. 
4. Get QICD and Linear programming lambda on the same scale.
