1. criteria cv for cv.rq.pen with qicd algorithm 
2. Update choice of lambda for all penalties
3. Warm starts in cv functions
4. Need to look into penVar 
5. rq.group.fit returns SCAD as penalty when it is actually LASSO 
6. Penalized rho calculations for rq.group.pen 
7. Penalty.factor for rq.nc
8. update get lambda max to depend on the penalty, and maybe make it bigger for sparsity.
